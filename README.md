Tip: To make it look like this screenshot,

1. Go to the category ACP and set `# of recent replies` to 0. 
2. Under Installed Plugins -> Lavender Theme, disable Masonry (or use the Vanilla theme)
3. Go to Appearance -> Custom CSS panel and add the following code:

```
.category-item .category-box .category-info {
    min-height: 85px;
}
```

Or just theme it however you want :)
